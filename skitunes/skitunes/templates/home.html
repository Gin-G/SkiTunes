            Welcome to SkiMovieSongs.com!
        </h1>
        <div class="bubble">
            You've discovered a Massive database of soundtracks for nearly every ski movie ever produced. <br>
            Our snowboard movies database is coming soon and we look forward to expanding into all of your other favorite extreme sports.

            The idea started with the simple recognition that many of us listen to, learn about, share,<br> 
            and enjoy the music that's featured in our favorite ski and snowboard films. <br>
            Think of how many times you've heard a friend say or asked the following yourself:<br>
            <br>
            <div class="italic-left">"What movie was this song in??"</div><br>                                                          
            <div class="italic-mid">"This song would be great in a ski movie!"</div><br>                                                                               
            <div class="italic-right">"Isn't this from that pow scene in...?"</div><br> 
            Now you can find out with ease! I have a lot in store for this site but for now you can use <br>
            the search fields below to figure out if that song currently stuck in your head really was in<br>
            the opening segment of MSP's Seven Sunny Days…<br>

            <form>
                Song Name : <input type="text" id="song_name" name="song_name"><br>
                Song Artist : <input type="text" id="song_artist" name="song_artist"><br>
                <input type="submit" value="Search!">
            </form>
            <div class="big-bold">A lot in store? Like what?</div><br>
            If you're anything like us it's probably a lot….or at least every now and then. <br>
            If not then we've at least now got you thinking about it. You're welcome :)<br>
            <div class="big-bold">Ok…Get to the point….</div><br>  
            Our goal is simple: We want to see winter and deep snow continue for many generations to<br> 
            come and we want to give you something in return for helping us to do it. We've founded a<br> 
            501c.3 non-profit called "Snowfficiency" dedicated to investing in energy efficiency projects<br> 
            in our built environment that achieve the greatest possible reduction in carbon footprint<br> 
            and greenhouse gas emissions per dollar spent. We are opening our database to you in <br>
            exchange for donations to this cause. Here's how it works:<br>  
            <div class="mid-bold">1.</div> Search our database according to skier/rider, location, production company, film title,<br> 
            musician, segment type, and potentially some other cool fields.<br> 
            <div class="mid-bold">2.</div> We'll tell you how many tracks match your search criteria and give you a preview.<br>  
            <div class="italic-mid">Some Examples:</div>
            <div class="italic-mid">Tracks by MSP & TGR that were Park segments <br>
            Tracks featuring Shane McKonkey or Sarah Burke <br>
            Tracks played during Japan Powder segments  <br></div>
            <div class="mid-bold">3.</div> Donate to Snowfficiency and we'll generate a playlist from the tracks that match your<br> 
            search criteria and send it to your email, Spotify, Songza, or Rdio account already compiled for your enjoyment.<br> 
            <div class="mid-bold">4.</div> We'll track your generous donation and let you know what project you helped to fund<br> 
            with details about the project such as carbon and greenhouse gas reductions produced,<br> 
            trees planted, or equivalent gas-guzzling trips to the mountain saved.<br>
            <div class="big-bold">What will you give me for free?</div><br> 
            We'll always allow you to search our database by a song title and artist to see if it was in a<br> 
            ski movie. We'll tell you which one it was in but that's all you get! No skier/rider info.<br> 
            No segment details. You have to help us save some snow for that.<br>
            <div class="big-bold">Isn't Protect Our Winters (POW) already doing this?</div><br> 
            POW is an outreach organization but doesn't directly fund projects that reduce the crap<br> 
            that's making our winters disappear. We've actually partnered with POW and 25% of your<br> 
            donation goes directly to them to help continue their efforts. If you haven't joined POW<br>
            as a supporter please do so! Support them through this <a href="https://protectourwinters.org/donate-to-pow/"> LINK</a>  and we'll give you 100 songs in<br> 
            playslists for free.<br>  
            <div class="big-bold">Can I just donate?</div><br> 
            Absolutely! You can do so <a href="https://www.venmo.com/u/Nick-Cote-1"> HERE</a><br>  
            <div class="big-bold">Can I help you without donating money?</div><br> 
            Yes please! Nearly every production company we've contacted has been incredibly helpful in<br> 
            filling in our database but there are a few films and tracks out there we haven't yet finished<br> 
            tagging. If you watch some of these films for us and tag our misssing pieces we'll give you<br> 
            credit for building some playlists of your own.<br>
